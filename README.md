# What's this
My Race Inspired Car Enhancement (RICE).
The files constantly change, some of the screenshots might be outdated as well.
Generally the one on top marked "latest" is always up to date.

# Screens

You can change the color theme by changing your wallpaper:

# Usage
`./setup.sh`.
This script makes all your configs a symlink of whatever files are in here, so it *will wipe your current configs*.
Yea I use it to quickly set it up on new installs but you probably don't want it.

# Notes
There might be some changes that you don't like. This section lists a few changes that might annoy you:

| Change | Location of config |
| --- | --- |
| Caps is Esc | `.Xmodmap` |
| Synaptic Trackpad disabled by default | `.xprofile` |

# Keybinds
Here are some extra stuff I added.
Most of the other keybinds are default unless stated otherwise.

## ranger
| Key combo | Function |
| --- | --- |
| bw | Set background and generate new theme based on the image under your cursor. |
| bl | Set lock screen wallpaper based on the image under your cursor. Does not generate theme. |

## vim
There's really quite a few here, please read the config. This is just the more obvious ones:

| Key combo | Function |
| --- | --- |
| ij | Esc. |
| F5 | Generate a temp pdf if you're in a markdown doc. Also refreshs mupdf if you used F4. |
| F4 | Opens mupdf to view your preview generated by F5. |
| F3 | noh. After you search for something F3 will disable the highlighting. |
| F2 | Builds tags with ctags. Must have ctags installed. |
| F1 | Calls ale plugin to format your code. Requires setup on your part. |
| Ctrl c | Copies to system clipboard. Requires vim compiled with +clipboard. |
| Ctrl v | In insert mode, pastes from system clipboard. Requires +clipboard. |
| Ctrl+hjkl | Replaces Ctrl+W+hjkl for split focus. |
| Ctrl+w+hjkl | Replaces Ctrl+w+HJKL for split motion. |
